# RubyPromotionsApp
My very first experiment with Ruby and with TDD

A very simple checkout program developed in TDD using RSpec.  
You can define different products and different promotions;  
promotions affect the total price using a simple Visitor pattern, so it's easy to add or remove different promotions.
Take a look at the test to see how this thing works :)
